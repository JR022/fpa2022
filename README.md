Code used in my Financial Portfolio Analysis module to analyse share prices and find the efficient frontier, as well as find efficient portfolios and assess their future performance.
I analysed share price data over the financial year April 2018 to April 2019 for the companies Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
